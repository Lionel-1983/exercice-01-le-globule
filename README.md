# exercice-01-le-globule

The goal of this exercise is to create menu and sub menu which disappear.

Menu : table-cell for menu items.

li in relative position and board in absolute position.

Also table-cell for right and left columns with vertical alignment corresponding to bottom.

footer links are styled in inline-block.

we add a max-width: 100% to restrict the images.

The green half-circles of the h2 are made thanks to a border-left 

coupled with border-radius. See the complete files: exercise-01-le-globule.
